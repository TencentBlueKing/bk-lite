Integration details page (automatic access): Collection configuration: renders fields by type for filling; basic information: nodes (with permissions), name, grouping; generates records after creation, supports viewing status and modification.<br />3. Log output view: Frontend displays collected log labels and metric fields; presented through Markdown templates.<br />4. Log reception interface: List-style layout including: name, grouping, collection method, nodes, status/time, installation method; operations: edit, update configuration, delete.<br />5. Log grouping rules: Add rules: name, collection type (dropdown), rule logic (any/all); rule conditions: field selection, conditions (contains/equals etc.), value input; rule list: displays name, logic description, grouping, type, time, operations.<br />6. Initial rules: Built-in "All Log Data" rule belongs to "default" group; only grouping can be modified, others cannot be deleted or changed.<br />7. New fields: Added "receiving instance" field, filtered by collection type.|
|Log Search|1. Log search permissions: Filter log display by user's organization; "Log Grouping" dropdown options need to be filtered by current user permissions.<br /> 2. Terminal mode: Supports switching between list mode and terminal mode; terminal mode supports real-time dynamic log refresh.<br />3. Log search page: (1) Search conditions: time range and auto-refresh (same as monitoring); log grouping (user permission filtered); query statement input box (with example descriptions on the side). (2) Query histogram: displays distribution of logs matching conditions (referring to weops). (3) Log display: list headers: time, source, message; expanded top shows: id, timestamp, receiver name; expanded body: field name + value display, supports adding field names/values to query statements.|
