# Module names and display names (from module list translations in group_data_rule_viewset.py)
# These are display names for various modules in the system, need to be translated according to actual module list

# Basic constants
# Currently system_mgmt mainly contains error messages, with fewer basic constants
# New constants requiring translation can be added here as needed
